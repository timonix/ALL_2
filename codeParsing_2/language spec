- variables are defined at the top of scope
- structs are defined globally

indexing into struct is done with .

struct Books {
   int  book_id;
   double  cost;
   int  title[25];
};

books.book_id = 5;

indexing into array is done with []

books.title[0]

array lengths are fixed and can be accessed with .len

books.title.len

comments are done with //

a = books.title.len //this is a comment

------ Functions --------
functions are global and static

main function marks entry point

main(){

}
